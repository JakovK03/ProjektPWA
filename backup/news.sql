(1, 'Under new defence minister Andrei Belousov, FSB is tackling corruption aggressively with serious implications for Ukraine', '‘Putin’s patience snapped’: Insiders marvel at Russia’s military purge', 'In the weeks since Vladimir Putin sacked his longtime defence minister Sergei Shoigu, Russia’s FSB security service has pursued a series of high-level corruption cases against a deputy minister and department heads in what many insiders are now calling a purge in the defence ministry.\r\n\r\nAndrei Belousov, the technocrat economist appointed to replace Shoigu, has a mandate to reduce corruption in the defence ministry and streamline military production for a long war against Ukraine that could largely be decided by industrial output.\r\n\r\nBut former defence and Kremlin officials, ex-officers and foreign observers have said it was likely the exit of Shoigu and loss of his protection that has allowed the FSB, the Russian security department responsible for internal investigations, to take down powerful officials in a power struggle that could have knock-on effects for how Russia fights the war in Ukraine.\r\n\r\n“The FSB finally got their teeth in the defence ministry and general staff,” said Capt John Foreman, the UK’s former defence attache to Moscow, who said he believed the arrests could continue after “Putin’s patience had finally snapped”.\r\n\r\n“Shoigu and Gerasimov provided a buffer, but now Putin decided he had to do something,” he said. “Shoigu kept the FSB largely away from the ministry throughout his tenure, there were very few arrests. Once the FSB has their teeth in you, who knows how far they will go.”\r\n\r\nThroughout the war in Ukraine, Shoigu and Gerasimov have come under fire from pro-war advocates for the military’s setbacks and their failure to eradicate pervasive corruption within the armed forces. Last summer, this dissatisfaction reached its peak when Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of the Wagner paramilitary group, initiated an unsuccessful rebellion against the military’s leaders.\r\n\r\nInteragency rivalries run deep in Russia, and Shoigu’s ouster may have given investigators in the FSB and investigative committee an opportunity to dust off criminal cases against the top brass in an effort to seek promotions and praise.\r\n\r\n“It’s the dream of any investigator to put a real live deputy minister of defence in prison, it’s cool, it’s the dream of a lifetime,” said one former Kremlin official. “You get new epaulettes for that, a promotion, some kind of award. You can earn a reputation for that.”\r\n\r\nIn the case of high-level prosecutions, the official said, Putin would probably be informed before an arrest was sought. But, the official added, he said it was unlikely the corruption cases were being initiated by the Kremlin itself.\r\n\r\nIn the span of a month, four top defence officials were arrested on corruption charges, marking the most significant crackdown in the defence ministry in years. The purge began on 23 April with the shock arrest of the veteran deputy defence minister Timur Ivanov for suspected bribe-taking.\r\n\r\nAddressing the recent series of arrests, the Kremlin on Thursday denied any suggestion of a crackdown within the defence ministry.\r\n\r\n“The fight against corruption is consistent work,” the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday. “It is not a campaign, it is constantly ongoing work.”\r\n\r\nIvanov was a long-term confidant and protege of Sergei Shoigu. His detention is believed to have laid the groundwork for Shoigu’s dismissal, who was subsequently replaced as defence minister by Belousov.\r\n\r\nIn the weeks that followed, additional high-ranking officials were detained. These included Yuri Kuznetsov, the head of the ministry’s personnel department, and Vadim Shamarin, the head of the communications department of the Russian general staff. Hours after Shamarin’s arrest on Thursday, Russia’s investigative committee also reported detaining another defence ministry official – Vladimir Verteletsky, who headed a division in the state defence procurement department of the ministry.\r\n\r\nWhile the Kremlin announced earlier this month that Russia’s top general, Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the general staff, would retain his position, the arrest of Shamarin, a direct deputy of Gerasimov, could weaken the general’s standing within the military hierarchy.\r\n\r\n“The probability of Gerasimov’s dismissal has gone up. I would sell my shares in him right now,” said Foreman.\r\n\r\nA former defence official said the arrests showed that the balance of power had swung in favour of Russia’s security services, while its military appears in disarray.\r\n\r\n“The FSB’s department of counterintelligence operations (1st division) is becoming increasingly powerful. They currently hold all the cards and are tightening the screws,” said the official, who worked closely with Ivanov and Shoigu.\r\n\r\n“It is not that Belousov’s arrival led to the purges, but the departure of Shoigu and his strongmen resource that enabled the arrest,” the official continued. “Shoigu in the end was a silovik [member of the security elite] and had their backing.”\r\n\r\nRussian prosecutors have also gone after a senior general best known for his criticism of Shoigu and Gerasimov.\r\n\r\nMaj Gen Ivan Popov, who commanded the 58th Combined Arms force, said last summer that he had been fired after he brought up problems on the battlefield, including the lack of counter-battery fire, and deaths and injuries the army was suffering from Ukrainian attacks. Popov, who Russian media said stood accused of stealing 100m roubles (£868,569) of metal, was arrested on Tuesday and placed in a pre-detention facility.\r\n\r\nGleb Irisov, a former Russian air force lieutenant who left the military in 2020, said he had spoken with an FSB source before the arrests who told him that the purge in the defence ministry would be prompted mainly by its failures in Ukraine.\r\n\r\n“Under Sergei Shoigu, the defence ministry became heavily influenced by his personal network,” said Irisov. “From senior commanders to lower staff, key positions were filled with Shoigu’s picks – friends or friends of friends. He even created numerous deputy positions specifically for his allies.”\r\n\r\nThose have included a reported mistress of Sergei Shoigu’s who headed companies that earned millions of pounds from contracts with the defence ministry.\r\n\r\nIrisov said he regularly discovered substandard equipment in the military, including lightbulbs that melted at supersonic speeds while flying Russia’s modern Su-35 air-defence fighter, as well as shoddy trucks and air defence systems unable to shoot down modern drones. He said in part their deficiencies were the result of corruption under Shoigu.\r\n\r\n“The overall quality of the military suffered because funds were routinely embezzled,” he said. “Military exercises often existed only on paper, as the allocated money was siphoned off.”', '27-05-24n01.jpg', '2024-05-27', 'news'),
(2, 'Claim rests on a misquoted section of FBI policy in a legal motion, and moreover, Trump was not even in Florida during the search', 'Trump revives false claim that Biden authorized ‘deadly force’ for Mar-a-Lago search', 'Donald Trump’s campaign has issued another extraordinary fundraising request to supporters by doubling down on a false claim that rival Joe Biden was prepared to hurt or kill him by authorizing the use of deadly force during an FBI search for classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago compound in August 2022.\r\n\r\nThe claim has become a currency among some Trump supporters and is widely described by them as an “attempted assassination” – but rests on a misquoted section of FBI policy in a legal motion. Moreover, Trump was not even in Florida during the search.\r\n\r\nThe revival of the claim came late Sunday came in the form of an email to supporters headlined:“This is an Alert from Donald Trump.” “DEADLY FORCE? Biden authorized it. They brought guns to the raid on Mar-a-Lago!” it read.\r\n\r\n“I’m sick and tired of the Radical Left destroying this country and trying to destroy me,” it continued, before detailing raids, indictments and arrests Trump claims he has been subjected to for political purposes.\r\n\r\n“Here’s the bottom line: I WILL NEVER SURRENDER. AND NEITHER WILL YOU!’ It concluded with a request for donations of up to $500 and a demand to “drop all charges” against him.\r\n\r\nAs laid out in the justice department’s justice manual. agents are permitted to use deadly force “when necessary, that is, when the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person”. It is standard procedure in many cases and the execution of a search warrant on Mar-a-Lago was communicated ahead of time with Trump’s Secret Service detail.\r\n\r\nIn a statement, the FBI described the language as “a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force. No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter.”\r\n\r\nSince leaving office in 2021, Trump is estimated to have spent more than $100m on lawyers and other costs related to various investigations, indictments and legal defense costs – or roughly $90,000 a day.\r\n\r\nMost of those expenses are met by donations in to political action committee and campaign funds set up to contest the results of the 2020 election. But those accounts are running low, and the former president could be facing a cash crunch.\r\n\r\nBut Trump’s claims ignore the realities that fears of rising political violence during this election cycle are mostly focused on the threat from the far right.\r\n\r\n“You know they’re just itching to do the unthinkable,” read the previous Trump campaign fundraising email, signed with the former president’s name. “Joe Biden was locked & loaded ready to take me out & put my family in danger.”\r\n\r\nThe government’s charges that Trump hid classified documents taken from the White House at the end of his term and then refused requests to turn them over is currently stalled by legal challenges.\r\n\r\nBut the sense that the government itself is working against justice in the case of Trump is a powerful fundraising tool for his campaign.\r\n\r\nTrump’s latest assassination-warning email comes as his trial on campaign finance charges is coming to a conclusion in New York. Final prosecution and defense arguments are expected on Tuesday. Opinion polls suggest that the month-long proceedings have not so far moved the needle either way on Trump but merely served to reinforce existing opinions.\r\n\r\nBut a verdict could change that – or not. Either way both presidential candidates are likely to make political hay from whichever way it goes. Trump has made the dingy corridor outside the courtroom a campaign stage, with Republican allies turning up daily to show their support.\r\n\r\nAccording to Politico last week, Biden plans to address the matter once a verdict is reached. But he may do so from the White House, not from the campaign trail, to show his statement isn’t political. But with political heat rising, the reactions of both men will likely be seen primarily through the political lens.', '27-05-24n02.png', '2024-05-27', 'news'),
(3, 'Two-time PGA Tour winner dies Saturday morning aged 30; Murray withdrew from Colonial tournament on Friday', 'Professional golfer Grayson Murray, two-time PGA Tour winner, dies aged 30', 'The two-time PGA Tour winner Grayson Murray died on Saturday morning at the age of 30, one day after he withdrew from the Charles Schwab Cup Challenge at Colonial.\r\n\r\nThere were no immediate details on the circumstances of his death, only shock and grief from the PGA Tour and his management team.\r\n\r\n“I am at a loss for words,” the PGA Tour commissioner, Jay Monahan, said. “The PGA Tour is a family, and when you lose a member of your family, you are never the same. We mourn Grayson and pray for comfort for his loved ones.”\r\n\r\nHis management company, GSE Worldwide, confirmed the death and said it was heartbroken.\r\n\r\n“We will hold off on commenting until we learn further details, but out heart aches for his family, his friends and all who loved him during this very difficult time,” GSE said in a statement.\r\n\r\nMonahan said he spoke with Murray’s parents to offer condolences, and they asked that the tournament in Fort Worth, Texas, continue.\r\n\r\nHe said grief counselors would be on site at the PGA Tour and Korn Ferry Tour event. Monahan said he was headed to Texas.\r\n\r\n“To see the devastation on the faces of every player coming in is really difficult to see and really just profound,” Monahan said. “Grayson was a remarkable player, but he was a very courageous man. I’ve always loved that about him.”\r\n\r\nMurray, who had dealt with alcohol and mental health issues in the past, made a massive turnaround this year and won the Sony Open, hitting wedge to three feet for birdie on the final hole to get into a playoff and winning it with a 40-foot putt.\r\n\r\nHe also won the Barbasol Championship in 2017.\r\n\r\n“It was a huge shock. My heart sank,” said Webb Simpson, who learned of Murray’s death shortly before teeing off at Colonial. He said Murray was the first winner of his junior tournament and they shared the same swing coach as juniors.\r\n\r\n“I just hate it so much,” Simpson said. “I’m miss him. I’m thankful he was in the place with his faith before this morning happened.”\r\n\r\nMurray was No 58 in the world rankings coming off a tie for 43rd in the PGA Championship last week at Valhalla. He also made the cut in his Masters debut, finishing 51st, and was in the field for the US Open next month at Pinehurst No 2.\r\n\r\nMurray, who grew up in North Carolina, was among the most talented juniors in the country. He won the prestigious Junior World Championship in San Diego three straight years and earned the Arnold Palmer Scholarship at Wake Forest.\r\n\r\nHe wound up going to three colleges, lastly at Arizona State, and won as a 22-year-old PGA Tour rookie at the Barbasol Championship.\r\n\r\nMurray said in January that he had been sober for eight months, was engaged to be married, had become a Christian and felt his best golf was ahead of him. He was appointed to the 16-member Player Advisory Council.\r\n\r\n“My story is not finished. I think it’s just beginning,” Murray said in Hawaii. “I hope I can inspire a lot of people going forward that have their own issues.”\r\n\r\nMurray said he used to drink during tournament weeks as a rookie because he knew he had talent and felt he was invincible. He also brought attention to himself through social media, openly criticizing other players and getting into one social media spat with Kevin Na over Na’s reputation as a slow player.\r\n\r\nBut he felt like he turned the corner when he sought help – letting others fight for him, is how he explained it this year.\r\n\r\n“It took me a long time to get to this point,” Murray said in January. “That was seven years ago, over seven years ago. I’m a different man now. I would not be in this position right now today if I didn’t put that drink down eight months ago.”\r\n\r\nPeter Malnati played with Murray at Colonial. He offered to go on the CBS telecast Saturday afternoon and immediately broke down trying to talk about him.\r\n\r\n“It’s a huge loss for all of us on the PGA Tour,” Malnati said. “As much as we want to beat each other, we’re one big family, and we lost one today. It’s terrible.”', '25-05-24s01.jpeg', '2024-05-25', 'sports'),
(4, 'Slovenian has matched Anquetil’s 1960 feat, brushing away his competitors so effortlessly that a tour double may beckon', 'Pogacar’s Giro d’Italia domination seals place among cycling’s greats', 'Since Tadej Pogacar’s stage win on day two at the Oropa sanctuary three weeks ago, the only suspense in this year’s Giro d’Italia centred on the Slovenian’s eventual winning margin, and which stage-winning records he would match along the way.\r\n\r\nThree and a half kilometres from the summit of Monte Grappa, tackled twice on Saturday afternoon, it became clear: once again he had left the field trailing, his sixth stage win beckoned, along with a substantial increase in his overall winning margin, towards 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nBy the finish in Bassano del Grappa, Pogacar had equalled the standard set for absolute domination in the Giro in the past half-century, Eddy Merckx’s 1973 win, with half a dozen stages along the way. Pogacar had matched Jacques Anquetil’s feat of 1960, wearing the pink leader’s jersey for 18 days.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, the Giro has often been decided by mere seconds as it has in minutes; Pogacar rode into Rome on Sunday nine minutes and 56 seconds clear of the Colombian Dani Martínez, the biggest winning margin in the Giro since 1965. He has pushed his total of wins for the year to 14, in 30 race days, a success rate approaching that of Merckx at his best.\r\n\r\nOne vignette sums up this Giro, at the Passo Brocon finish on Wednesday. Approaching the final kilometre, with the group of overall contenders closing on the lone breakaway Georg Steinhauser, Geraint Thomas’s Ineos teammates set a fierce pace to dislodge one of Thomas’s rivals for second place, the Australian Ben O’Connor. When Martinez accelerated, Pogacar responded almost apologetically and drifted off the front of the group seemingly without meaning to.\r\n\r\nHe did not need to go deep to open a gap; having taken the two previous mountain stages he had no particular need to win the stage. He was effectively controlling the race with his immediate rivals trailing a few hundred metres behind, all of them completely incapable of closing the gap.\r\n\r\nThis Giro reinforces an unsettling truth. Along with Remco Evenepoel, Mathieu van der Poel, Primoz Roglic and – assuming he recovers from his horrendous crash in April – Jonas Vingegaard, “Pogi” is one of a small group of stars who are light years ahead of the rest of the peloton. Unless another of the “fantastic five” is present, they can be expected to win whenever they pull on a race number. At times it is enthralling, on other occasions, such as this Giro, it is a matter of statistics and record books.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, Thomas performed surprisingly well for a 38-year-old who rode his first Tour de France when Pogacar was barely off riding a bike with stabilisers, Martínez has ridden his best Grand Tour, and the young Italian Antonio Tiberi has visibly progressed, but none of them has been anywhere near good enough to shake Pogacar for a single second.\r\n\r\nThe double world champion Julian Alaphilippe has returned to his best with a stage win and some epic escapes and Italy has discovered a new sprinter in Jonathan Milan, but in terms of making the mighty Slovenian tremble, they have barely been a distraction.\r\n\r\nUntil a few close encounters with over-enthusiastic tifosi on the climb on Saturday, Pogacar had endured one minor hiccup: stage two’s minor pratfall after attempting to take a bend on a flat front tyre. There is a sportswriters’ cliche about the greats making their sport look shockingly easy; this is where Pogacar has been for the past three weeks.\r\n\r\nAt times it was easy to forget Pogacar had not won a Grand Tour for almost three years. Since his defeat at the 2022 Tour de France he has been rampant in one-day Classics, building an all-round record unparalleled since Bernard Hinault in the early 1980s. However, his struggles in the past two Tours underline that, however seamless a rider’s domination in a Grand Tour may look, the adjective “easy” is never appropriate.\r\n\r\nAt their best, cycling’s non-pareils such as Merckx, Hinault and Miguel Induráin seemed to function in a dimension where time and space were their own compared to the mere mortals. Pogacar has entered that place and the question now is whether he can back it up at the Tour de France, something no one has done since the drug-fuelled super-climber Marco Pantani in 1998.\r\n\r\nThe Slovenian will find stiffer competition there with Roglic, Evenepoel and probably Vingegaard on the start line and will face the challenge of retaining his form – or something close to it – until late July. But after the last three seamless weeks, few would bet against it.', '14-05-24s01.jpg', '2024-05-14', 'sports'),

There were 104 survivors rescued and 82 bodies recovered. It was one of the deadliest shipwrecks to have taken place in the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nThe disaster shocked Europe and the case has been followed closely in Greece, which has been a gateway to the EU for thousands of migrants and refugees.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday a Greek court dismissed charges against the nine men of setting up a criminal group and causing the shipwreck, citing lack of jurisdiction as the disaster occurred in international waters. The court also threw out charges of illegal entry into the country and people-smuggling.\r\n\r\nAfter the ruling, the men, who have spent 11 months in pre-trial detention and have pending asylum applications, were transferred to a police station where they remained in custody. It could take months for their applications to be processed.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday police said they should be detained as there was a risk that they could flee Greece. According to the decision, they will remain in detention until their asylum applications are processed.\r\n\r\nNatasha Dailiani, one the lawyers for the men, told Reuters it was “tragic and unacceptable”, adding that the men should have been freed and that they planned to appeal against the detention order.\r\n\r\n“It is inhumane to hold those people in detention after a court dismissed the charges against them and since they have already spent 11 months in prison in vain,” she said.\r\n\r\nPolice authorities were not immediately available for comment.\r\n\r\nThe shipwreck’s cause is officially undetermined.', '21-05-24n01.jpg', '2024-05-21', 'news'),

It also warned of a new trend in which drones armed with explosive weapons are used to target health facilities.\r\n\r\nLeonard Rubenstein, of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who chairs the coalition, said violence inflicted on healthcare workers and facilities had “reached appalling levels”. The report included examples where workers had been deliberately targeted, and others where combatants were reckless or indifferent to the harm caused, he said.\r\n\r\n“The lack of restraint we are seeing, from the beginning of conflicts, suggests to me that the law on protecting healthcare has had no meaning to combatants,” Rubenstein said.\r\n\r\n“The one consistent feature of the attacks was continued impunity for these crimes. For more than a decade, despite their repeated commitments, governments have failed to follow through on these commitments and reform their military practices, cease arms transfers to perpetrators, and bring those responsible for crimes to justice.”\r\n\r\nThe coalition is made up of more than 40 nongovernmental organisations and has produced annual reports for the past 11 years. It identified 2,562 incidents of violence against or obstruction of health care in conflicts in 2023.\r\n\r\nThese included 685 cases where health workers – including doctors, nurses, and ambulance drivers – were arrested or kidnapped, and 487 instances where they had been killed, almost double the number in 2022.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, health facilities were damaged or destroyed by both government forces and non-state armed groups. Those facilities were also “increasingly occupied or repurposed for military use”, in violation of humanitarian law, the report found.\r\n\r\nThe figures should be considered underestimates, because it is difficult to get information from conflict zones, the researchers said.\r\n\r\nThey identified 11 countries and territories where children’s health services were affected, including the bombing or occupation of al-Nasr Children’s Hospital in Gaza City, Juwana Amal Center for Children with Cancer in Khartoum and Kherson Regional Children’s Clinical Hospital in Ukraine.\r\n\r\nLongstanding conflicts have “cumulative and lasting effects”, the report warned, leaving little or no functioning health system even after the violence ends.\r\n\r\nRubenstein said: “The impact on access to healthcare, to the population, is enormous in the aftermath of these attacks – and continues even as conflicts decline, which we see in Tigray, Ethiopia, in Yemen – because of the destruction, or the severe damage to the health system, and the departure of so many health workers.”\r\n\r\nHe said statements by Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, and other officials condemning violence towards healthcare could be “a basis for more concerted global leadership”.\r\n\r\nRubenstein said that must include prosecutions to provide justice and act as a deterrent. Monday’s announcement by the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court that he was seeking arrest warrants for Hamas and Israeli officials for war crimes was “welcome”, he said.\r\n\r\n“We need accountability for many crimes in that war, but it’s important too for crimes specifically involving provision of healthcare or misuse of health facilities to be charged,” Rubenstein said. “And I think we still have not seen that.”', '22-05-24n01.jpg', '2024-05-22', 'news'),

The study highlights the potential degradation of drinking water and risk to fisheries in the Arctic.\r\n\r\n“When mixed with another river, it can actually make the metals even more potent [in its] impact to aquatic health,” Poulin said.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon was first observed in 2018, when researchers noticed the milky orange appearance of the rivers across northern Alaska’s Brooks Range, a stark contrast to the crystal clear waters seen the year prior.\r\n\r\nWithin the year, a tributary of the Akillik river in Kobuk Valley national park saw the complete loss of two local fish species: the dolly varden and the slimy sculpin.\r\n\r\n“Our data suggests that when the river turned orange, we saw a significant decrease in macroinvertebrates and biofilm on the bottom of the stream, which is essentially the base of the food web,” Poulin said of the rusting phenomenon. “It could be changing where fish are going to be able to live.”\r\n\r\nThe rusting is a seasonal phenomenon, occurring in the summer typically during July and August, when the soil is thawed the deepest. The researchers at the National Park Service, US Geological Survey and University of California Davis now want to better understand the long-term implications of the changing water chemistry in places with continuous permafrost, which includes Arctic regions such as Alaska, Canada, Russia and parts of Scandinavia.\r\n\r\n“It’s an area that’s warming at least two to three times faster than the rest of the planet,” said Scott Zolkos, an Arctic scientist at Woodwell Climate Research Center who was not involved in the study. “So we can expect these types of effects to continue.”\r\n\r\nThe research group shared that they were working closely with tribal liaisons in Alaska to ensure local communities get accurate information on the developing phenomenon.', '22-05-24n02.jpg', '2024-05-22', 'news'),
(9, 'Steve Baker says advisers came up with policy to bring back mandatory national service without agreeing it with ministers', 'Tories’ national service pledge was sprung on candidates, says minister', 'The Conservative campaign pledge to introduce mandatory national service was dreamed up by advisers and sprung on candidates, a government minister has said.\r\n\r\nCriticism of the headline-grabbing policy has centred on claims it was not fully thought through before being announced, while ministers said just two days before the announcement that a return of national service was not on the cards.\r\n\r\n“It’s a Conservative party policy. The government’s policy was set out on Thursday,” said the government minister Steve Baker, referring to his colleague Andrew Murrison’s previous insistence there were “no current plans to reintroduce national service”.\r\n\r\nBaker, who serves as a minister of state at the Northern Ireland Office, said on Monday: “I don’t like to be pedantic but a government policy would have been developed by ministers on the advice of officials and collectively agreed. I would have had a say on behalf of [Northern Ireland]. But this proposal was developed by a political adviser or advisers and sprung on candidates, some of whom are relevant ministers.”\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, called the proposal “desperate”, claiming the Conservatives were “rummaging around in the toy box to find any plan they can throw on the table”.\r\n\r\nHe said: “I don’t think it’ll work – you’ve seen what military experts, those with experience have said about it, you’ve seen what the government said about it just a few days ago when they were asked.”\r\n\r\nAnd he added: “The desperation of this national service policy – a teenage Dad’s Army – paid for by cancelling levelling up funding and money from tax avoidance that we would use to invest in our NHS.”\r\n\r\nFour days ago, Murrison told parliament: “If potentially unwilling national service recruits were to be obliged to serve alongside the professional men and women of our armed forces, it could damage morale, recruitment and retention and would consume professional military and naval resources.”\r\n\r\nIn response to a written question from his party colleague Mark Pritchard, the defence minister wrote: “If, on the other hand, national service recruits were kept in separate units, it would be difficult to find a proper and meaningful role for them, potentially harming motivation and discipline. For all these reasons, there are no current plans for the restoration of any form of national service.”\r\n\r\nDays later, the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, announced his promise to restore a form of national service. Under the Tory proposal, about 30,000 people would be given the option of applying to serve with the military, while others would carry out different work in their communities.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the Foreign Office minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan refused to rule out the possibility of parents being fined if their adult children refused to take part. However, she fended off calls to explain details of the policy proposal, insisting a royal commission would draw them up after the election.\r\n\r\nTrevelyan also suggested that failure to carry out national service, should a Tory election victory mean it is reintroduced, could harm people’s job prospects.\r\n\r\nShe told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “This will be encouraged and will become part of the norms. Importantly, of course, when you then as a young person apply for a job, there will be a question that employers will want to know how you got involved – either because you were able to achieve one of the 30,000 places [in the armed forces] or because you were volunteering in one or other part of your community.”', '26-05-24n02.jpg', '2024-05-26', 'news'),
(10, 'Champions Cup defeat against Toulouse was another Leinster near miss and the time is right to obsess slightly less on defence', 'Leo Cullen needs to shift focus to attack if Leinster are to end final pain', 'In 2022 it was the Boulevard Michelet in Marseille. Last year it was Lansdowne Road in Dublin. On Saturday evening it was the slightly grittier backdrop of Tottenham High Road, but the post-match pain on the faces of Leinster supporters was wearily familiar. Three points, one point, an extra-time defeat: the margins are desperately slim but the sense of deja vu is growing stronger.\r\n\r\nMix in Ireland’s World Cup quarter-final defeat by the All Blacks and the so‑near‑yet‑so‑far pattern is impossible to ignore. Irish rugby still boasts plentiful talent but the uncomfortable losses are stacking up. As Leo Cullen, Leinster’s director of rugby, acknowledged, not all the postmortems will be sympathetic. “The lads are going to need to show a bit of character now,” he said. “You get a sense of what’s coming ... you lose another final and we’ve got to be able to deal with that.”\r\n\r\nTo some extent it is an occupational hazard of top-class sport. Toulouse are a great side and no club have the divine right to sew gold stars on their jerseys. Leinster remain superior to many other wannabes. But what are their downcast followers meant to do? Shrug their shoulders and await another runners-up medal next year? Or wonder aloud if there might be any underlying reasons why this particular bunch of players continue to fall agonisingly short?\r\n\r\nThe quality of France’s leading sides is clearly a factor. As with La Rochelle, there is no shame to losing against such classy opposition. The extraordinary Antoine Dupont is an all-time great and the burgeoning Top 14 has claimed four successive Champions Cup victories, with power to add. Toulouse have now won this tournament on a record six occasions and the scenes in the city’s Place du Capitole were suitably euphoric.\r\n\r\nBut even Leinster’s most loyal fans cannot ignore the obvious. Their team had their chances and didn’t take them. They turned down a string of kickable penalties, were never ahead and were unable to land the late drop goal that would have avoided extra time. Not all of it was down to the fates or an unsympathetic referee.\r\n\r\nWhat has happened, for example, to the attacking shape that once carved defences open under Stuart Lancaster’s tutelage? The modern game is about turning half‑chances into points, thinking smart and not necessarily doing the obvious, and the retired Johnny Sexton’s all-seeing brain remains conspicuously absent.\r\n\r\nInstead Leinster now send Jacques Nienaber on to the field as a water boy to try to micro‑manage games. They pick a perfectly decent but limited fly-half to stick to a playbook that grows steadily less ambitious. Rather than grabbing the ball and kicking three points when they cried out to be taken on Saturday, they stuck to a prepared script which, ultimately, failed to exert sufficient scoreboard pressure.\r\n\r\nIn frenetic, tight games an obsession with control and playing the percentages is not always bearing fruit and other teams are also outlasting them physically. As was the case last season, where they let a 17-0 lead slip against a La Rochelle side who found another gear despite being reduced to 14 men late on, they were also unable to locate a sprint finish when they really needed one.\r\n\r\nToulouse, with Dupont and Jack Willis to the fore, had no such problems in a marathon encounter that, from kick‑off to the final whistle, ended up spanning two hours, 45 minutes.\r\n\r\nDupont did make a couple of small errors but cranked up his performance to a whole different level when it mattered. Leinster had some outstanding contributors – how good was Caelan Doris? – but need a few more players with the ability and aura to shape big games in the way Sexton and Brian O’Driscoll once did.\r\n\r\nThat steely self-belief is less apparent these days, which may be another reason why the Springbok lock RG Snyman and New Zealand’s versatile Jordie Barrett will be wearing Leinster blue next season. Harsh, perhaps, but it feels like the time to try a different starting 10 and to obsess slightly less about defence at the expense of greater attacking variation.\r\n\r\nBut Leinster are a sizeable tanker and, as Nienaber and Cullen have been finding, these things do not happen overnight. That nervy Croke Park semi-final – when Northampton almost caught them napping after a poor start – also now feels less like a blip than it did previously.\r\n\r\nMaybe the World Cup disappointment is still sapping a few minds and bodies, with Ireland’s defeat against England at Twickenham another potential case study. True, Andy Farrell’s Leinster‑dominated squad still collected another Six Nations title but the tour to South Africa this summer suddenly feels a tougher gig than it did a few months ago.\r\n\r\nEither way, from Leinster’s perspective, only a glorious victory in next year’s final – to be staged in Cardiff on 24 May – can now ease the collective pain. Professional sport can be wonderfully fulfilling but, equally, it is a brutal playground. While Leinster still have huge support, significant financial muscle and a steady supply of schoolboy talent, the external pressure is rising.\r\n\r\n“There is still a belief that we can do this,” Cullen insisted. In their heart of hearts, though, Leinster’s high command will know that something has to change.', '26-05-24s01.jpg', '2024-05-26', 'sports'),

From 4-0 up in the third set of her French Open first-round match against Lucia Bronzetti, a match largely decided on her racket, Osaka’s nerves began to wreak havoc. She soon found herself on the verge of a crushing defeat.\r\n\r\nWhen she truly needed to step up, though, Osaka steadied herself and recovered. After three turbulent sets, she moved into the second round with a 6-1, 4-6, 7-5 victory.\r\n\r\nDespite the tight result, Osaka did demonstrate some periods of ­genuine quality against the world No 67. She was excellent in the ­opening set, serving well and ­crushing the ball with ease, then she established a 4-0 lead in the final set with ­similarly dominant play. But those positive moments were bookended by ­nervous, error-strewn periods as the 26-year-old’s feet became rooted to the ground and her errors missed the court by sizeable margins.\r\n\r\nTo her credit, while trailing 4-5 in the final set after losing five successive games, Osaka steadied herself with some excellent serving and she rolled through the final three games to advance.\r\n\r\nThe victory marks Osaka’s first win in a grand slam match since January 2022, when she reached the third round of the Australian Open. Afterwards, she said her desperation to finally advance past the first round was the primary reason for her nerves.\r\n\r\n“That was exactly the reason,” Osaka said. “I was in my head, ­thinking I didn’t win a match in ­Australia so I’d really love to win one here. Obviously that wasn’t a good train of thought. I kind of focused on it a bit too much instead of trying to play point by point, and I think towards the end I was able to erase that thought from my head. But I would love to not have to go through that rollercoaster again.”\r\n\r\nSince returning from maternity leave at the beginning of the year, Osaka has had to accept gradual progress rather than immediately blazing through the draws and ­re-establishing her level of old.\r\n\r\nThis seemed to be another of those moments, another small step forward. Perhaps she will feel more ­composed the next time she is charged with closing out a grand slam match.\r\n\r\nDuring her press conference on Saturday, questions about the draw prompted a suspicious Osaka to ask, with a chuckle, that reporters not reveal any potential opponents beyond the first round. Now she knows. By beating Bronzetti, Osaka has done her part of the deal ahead of a potential second-round match against Iga Swiatek, the top seed and tournament favourite. Swiatek will open her tournament on Monday against Léolia Jeanjean, a qualifier from France.\r\n\r\n“Honestly, I didn’t really know [Swiatek was a potential opponent],” Osaka said. “But then after, I was like: ‘Why does everyone keep asking me about this draw?’ I knew that I was in the top half, so I was like, jokingly: ‘Well, it’s not like I’m playing Iga.’ Then everyone got quiet.\r\n\r\n“I’m honestly really excited. I watched her a lot when I was ­pregnant. I think it’s an honour to play her in the French Open, because she’s won more than once here. It’s like a very big honour and ­challenge for me.”\r\n\r\nWhile Osaka’s prospects of challenging Swiatek may be remote based on her opening performance, if the pair face each other she will at least have the benefit of playing against the world No 1 fully aware that the ­pressure will all be on the other side. It is a free hit, a chance for Osaka to impose herself and see where she stacks up against the best player in the world. But first, Swiatek must complete her part of the job.\r\n\r\n“[I’m] taking it as an experience and kind of knowing that I feel like I’m the underdog, and I think I thrive in those situations,” Osaka said. “So if I do play her, I’d be really excited to.”\r\n\r\nJelena Ostapenko, the ninth seed, reached the second round with a 6-4, 7-5 victory against Jaqueline Cristian of Romania.', '26-05-24s02.jpg', '2024-05-26', 'sports');

She shared her reports on X (then known as Twitter), YouTube and WeChat. She was one of the few independent Chinese reporters on the ground as Wuhan and the rest of China went into lockdown.\r\n\r\nIn one video, recorded in February 2020, Zhang said: “I can’t find anything to say except that the city is paralysed because everything is under cover. That’s what this country is facing now … They imprison us in the name of pandemic prevention and restrict our freedom. We must not talk to strangers, it’s dangerous. So without the truth, everything is meaningless. If we cannot get to the truth, if we cannot break the monopoly of the truth, the world means nothing to us.”\r\n\r\nIn another video, she showed a hospital that was overflowing with patients on trolleys in the hallway.\r\n\r\nZhang was arrested in May 2020 and later sentenced to four years in prison for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble”, a charge often used against activists. She has been held in Shanghai women’s prison ever since.\r\n\r\nDuring her time in prison, Zhang, who turned 40 in September, has engaged in periodic hunger strikes to protest against her conviction and treatment. One of her former lawyers, who has since been struck off, said that when he saw her in the winter of 2020 she was very thin, had a tube up her nose for force feeding, and had her hands tied, so that she could not pull out the tube. “People asked me to convince Zhang Zhan to eat something, but she insisted,” the lawyer said.\r\n\r\nHer weight reportedly dropped from 11st 8lb (74.8kg) to less than 6st 4lb (40.8kg) at one point, although she is thought to have been in better health in recent months.\r\n\r\nZhang’s former lawyer said that her case was treated “particularly harshly”. “The judge said that her crime was going to Wuhan to do interviews and investigations. But in fact, what the judge didn’t like was that she collected those materials and put them on Twitter … and received interviews from so-called enemy media,” said the lawyer, referring to publications such as the US government-funded Radio Free Asia.\r\n\r\nMaya Wang, the associate Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said: “It’s a relief to know that Zhang is being released, given her very poor health in prison, but she shouldn’t have been imprisoned in the first place. Her imprisonment should remind us all that the Chinese government is yet to be held accountable for covering up the Covid-19 outbreak, or for the abuses associated with its draconian pandemic restrictions.”\r\n\r\nWang said that there were fears that Zhang would not fully regain her freedom after release.\r\n\r\nZhang’s former lawyer said that there were likely two outcomes after her release. The first is that she will be sent home. “The other is that she will be sent somewhere to have ‘soft prison’ time for one to three months … based on my experience of dealing with so-called sensitive people, there will be a period of time where they are not allowed contact with the outside world, not allowed to move somewhere.”\r\n\r\nSarah Brooks, Amnesty International’s China director, said: “We urge the Chinese authorities to ensure that Zhang Zhan is fully free from 13 May. She must be allowed to move freely, to communicate with people inside and outside of China, and to reunite with her family. She and her family must not be subjected to surveillance or harassment, and the Chinese authorities must also ensure there are no restrictions on her access to medical treatment after her traumatic ordeal in jail.”\r\n\r\nJane Wang (not related to Maya Wang), a supporter of Zhang’s in the UK, noted that Zhang’s release comes soon after the anniversary of the death of Lin Zhao, a prominent Chinese dissident who was executed during the Cultural Revolution. “Zhang Zhan is young, but has the spirit of Lin Zhao in her,” Wang said. She is the equivalent of Lin Zhao in Xi’s era.”', '11-05-24n01.jpg', '2024-05-11', 'news'),

The presence of signatories from countries that have been less willing to bind national champions to safety regulation is a benefit of the lighter touch, the government says.\r\n\r\nThe UK’s technology secretary, Michelle Donovan, said the Seoul event “really does build on the work that we did at Bletchley and the ‘Bletchley effect’ that we created afterwards. It really had the ripple effect of moving AI and AI safety on to the agenda of many nations. We saw that with nations coming forward with plans to create their own AI safety institutes, for instance.\r\n\r\n“And what we’ve achieved in Seoul is we’ve really broadened out the conversation. We’ve got a collection from across the globe, highlighting that this process is really galvanising companies, not just in certain countries but in all areas of the globe to really tackle this issue.”\r\n\r\nThe longer the codes remained voluntary, however, the greater the risk was that AI companies would simply ignore them, said Fran Bennett, the interim director of the Ada Lovelace Institute.\r\n\r\n“People thinking and talking about safety and security, that’s all good stuff. So is securing commitments from companies in other nations, particularly China and the UAE. But companies determining what is safe and what is dangerous, and voluntarily choosing what to do about that, that’s problematic.\r\n\r\n“It’s great to be thinking about safety and establishing norms, but now you need some teeth to it: you need regulation, and you need some institutions which are able to draw the line from the perspective of the people affected, not of the companies building the things.”\r\n\r\nBennett also criticised the lack of transparency for training data. Even under the safety standards, companies are free to keep the data they train their models on completely secret, despite the risks known to come with biased or incomplete sources.\r\n\r\nDonovan argued that AI safety institutes such as the one in the UK have enough access to make data transparency unnecessary. “If the argument is that training data can present risks, then what the institute can do is go through the model and see if that model can itself present a risk,” she said. “That’s a million times more than what we had just over six months ago, when it was all down to the company.”\r\n\r\nOpenAI, another of the signatories to the standards, said they represented “an important step toward promoting broader implementation of safety practices for advanced AI systems.\r\n\r\nAnna Makanju, the company’s vice-president for global affairs, said “the field of AI safety is quickly evolving and we are particularly glad to endorse the commitments’ emphasis on refining approaches alongside the science”.\r\n\r\nThe presence of Chinese and Emirati signatories on the list is seen as vindicating Britain’s leadership in AI safety, the Guardian understands, because a US-led effort would have had little chance of being seen as neutral enough to attract support.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday evening, Sunak co-chaired a closed virtual meeting of world and business leaders with the South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol. Attendees, including Kamala Harris, Emmanuel Macron, Meta’s Nick Clegg and Twitter owner Elon Musk, agreed on further co-operation to progress AI safety science, a Whitehall source said.', '21-05-24n03.jpg', '2024-05-21', 'news'),
(17, 'UK relationship ‘isn’t taking up as much of our mental space as it was a few years ago’, says EU diplomat', 'EU keen to deepen ties with a Labour PM but will not offer radical concessions', 'Since 2016, Britain’s Conservatives have compared the European Union to Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, described a senior EU official’s remarks as “bizarre and stupid” and threatened to break international law with a unilateral rewrite of the Brexit deal. So an incoming Labour government does not have to do much to strike a different tone.\r\nBut while the EU is ready to deepen ties with a future Labour government – widely assumed to take office after 4 July – it will not offer radical concessions to Keir Starmer. EU sources, already welcoming warmer relations under Rishi Sunak, are looking cautiously at the changing political weather across the Channel.\r\n\r\nOfficials see potential for a better relationship with the UK under a Starmer government but say any agreements – whether on easier trade for fresh food, student exchange or youth mobility – would require the UK to accept “rules and responsibilities”.\r\n\r\n“If the UK is looking for a more positive relationship, they will be pushing an open door at this end,” said one EU diplomat, pointing out that closer ties have been on offer to successive Conservative governments. “There is potentially a lot available in terms of closer relationships … But that has been available at any time, and of course there are responsibilities and rules attached to it from the UK side.”\r\n\r\nTerry Reintke, a German Green MEP, who is her group’s joint leading candidate in the European elections, said she was hopeful any change in government would bring a more positive relationship. “I think that there are so many areas where we have to work together more closely. One very obvious example is foreign and security policy,” she said in an interview in her Brussels office, where hanging on the wall is an EU-UK scarf from the emotional last parliamentary session attended by British MEPs in 2020. “With the war in Ukraine, it has just become more obvious that we have to work closely together as allies.”\r\n\r\nThe Green MEP, who did an Erasmus exchange at Edinburgh university, said she hoped the election would lead to less polarisation in the UK. Recent Tory governments, she said, had shown “pointless hostility towards the EU [that] was really not dignified for this old Conservative party”.\r\n\r\nBrussels insiders stress EU-UK relations have already dramatically improved under Sunak, since the prime minister signed the Windsor framework, ending years of dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol.\r\n\r\n“There is often a sense in the UK, from what we see, that the EU offered a worse deal to the Tories because the Tories are so negative. I just don’t think that that’s reality,” the diplomat said. “It had everything to do with the positions taken by the UK government and nothing to do with politics of the UK government.”\r\n\r\nStill, while the EU grapples with internal splits over supporting Ukraine, tensions with China and upcoming EU elections, the UK is far from a priority. A second EU diplomat cautioned against overestimating the importance of British politics: “There isn’t that sense of ‘yes, here comes a Labour government’, because over the past year and a half we have worked quite nicely with the last Conservative government. And the EU-UK relationship isn’t taking up as much of our mental space as it was a few years ago.\r\n\r\nUnder Starmer, Labour has ruled out rejoining the single market and customs union, much less the entire EU. Instead, the party has said it wants to reduce trade barriers and sign an EU-UK security agreement. The shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, last month said Labour wanted “a new geopolitical partnership” with the EU.\r\n\r\n“The centrepiece of this relationship should be a security pact that drives closer coordination across a wide variety of military, economic, climate, health, cyber, and energy security issues, and that complements both parties’ unshakable commitment to Nato,” Lammy wrote in Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\nIf successful, a Starmer government would soon be able to showcase its new approach when it hosts more than 40 countries for a European Political Community summit at Blenheim Palace on 18 July. “We notice some attempts in the UK to get closer to the EU and to be a stronger geopolitical actor,” said a third diplomat. “[The] European Political Community summit will be a major stage to prove that the UK wants to make a difference.”\r\n\r\nDespite the goodwill, Labour could soon find itself in difficult waters, as illustrated by a recent surprise proposal from the European Commission on youth mobility. Labour and the government quickly ruled out a post-Brexit deal that would allow people aged 18-30 to live, study and work on both sides of the Channel for up to four years.\r\n\r\nThe commission’s proposal would be difficult for any cash-strapped UK government under tight public spending limits. Under the youth mobility deal, the commission said EU students should pay the same tuition fees at British universities as their UK classmates, with the NHS surcharge dropped for all people on the scheme. Both measures cost money, demonstrating that improving ties with the EU comes with trade-offs for any government – Conservative or Labour.\r\n\r\n“Great if the Starmer government comes in and is willing and able to work closer with the EU,” the first EU diplomat said. “But being willing and able means they have to make the compromises that would be necessary in order for the positive closer relationship and be able to sell that back home. So, we will wait and see.”\r\n“If a Labour government comes with ideas and credible proposals – and I can’t underscore the word ‘credible’ enough – we would be willing to discuss and entertain those conversations,” the diplomat said.', '30-05-24n01.jpg', '2024-05-30', 'news'),
(18, 'A change is no guarantee of success. But a wider pool of talent could help improve the game for players, fans and even the officials themselves', 'Foreign players revolutionised the Premier League. Should refs from abroad be next?', 'The modern Premier League, in its self-mythology, is all about flow: the flow of the game (technically sophisticated, “end to end”, heavy on goals and improbable acts of attacking wizardry); the flow of players from country to country and club to club; the flow of managers, who have become the new football economy’s ultimate mercenaries amid a murderous churn of coaching staff hirings and firings; the flow of owners, a multiplying collection of asset strippers, money launderers, nation states grasping at global status and power, and venture capitalists out to make a quick buck; the flow of supporters, as old loyalties have loosened and allegiances have become more transactional, more revisable; and the flow, above all, of money, prodigious amounts of money, without which none of the weekly somersaulting, \"knee-sliding\", corner-flag-slapping extravaganza of the Premier League would be possible.\r\n\r\nContinuous movement is the league’s mantra, both on and off the pitch. Footballs, pounds, dollars, people: all of them must be kept in a constant state of motion, ready for action whenever and wherever opportunity arises. Removal of restrictions on the circulation of labor and capital has been a key part of the English top flight’s emergence as a truly international league over the past three decades. The Premier League now stands uncontested as the world’s most powerful advertisement for sporting globalization, and its journey from parochial stronghold of the English game – all mud, tackling, team spirit, and British grit – to central clearing house of the world’s footballing passions can be told in a single statistical pair. On the first weekend of the inaugural Premier League season, in 1992, there were only 13 foreign players among the 22 starting lineups; of the 533 players registered at the start of the 2023-24 season, 360 – more than two-thirds – were from outside the UK.\r\n\r\nFrictionless, borderless, and filthily profitable, the Premier League nevertheless retains one small foothold in footballing regionalism: almost all referees in English football, even in the top flight, are English. Somewhat incongruously, a league that is now the playpen of pickpocket Scandinavian forwards, unstinting Japanese wingers, and Zara-model Spanish managers is still officiated by a proud core of homegrown referees. In theory there’s nothing wrong with this, of course. Even for those of us who watch from overseas, maintaining a sense of Englishness about the English game seems important in a world where sport is becoming flattened and globalized, where elite football leagues are losing the quirks and eccentricities that give them an identity. Squalid plans such as the dormant Super League, however much fans rightly rail against them, in all likelihood represent the future of elite club football in Europe, in which the historic distinctions between leagues will melt away and the sport will dissolve into a single, low-stakes exhibition of charmless footballing perfection. Against that backdrop, the Premier League’s persistence with its mild policy of refereeing nativism seems almost sensible, like a charmingly anachronistic nod to what’s left of English football heritage.\r\n\r\nBut this is, unfortunately, before one actually considers the work that English referees produce on a weekly basis. Fans have always moaned about referees, of course, and adjudicative howlers from English officials are a rich part of the sport’s history: who could forget Graham Poll, the only English referee at the 2006 World Cup, handing a player three yellow cards?\r\n\r\nBut things definitely seem to have become worse over the past couple of seasons, and the Premier League’s new confusion of technology and video assistants has made officiating a far greater focus of debate among fans than it was even five years ago. Suddenly, referees have joined players and managers among the sport’s main characters. For the committed fan, Anthony Taylor, Michael Oliver, Chris Kavanagh, and Simon Hooper are now names that roll off the tongue as easily as those of the biggest players, and time throughout the league season is marked as much by officiating calamities as by goals and match results. The missed penalty for André Onana’s Schumacheresque hack on Sasa Kalajdzic, the two unawarded red cards in Newcastle’s match at home to Arsenal, the farce of the video review for Luis Diaz’s disallowed goal against Spurs: the season just ended was rich in refereeing misfortune, and those examples came from only the first two months.\r\n\r\nIt hasn’t helped matters that the protocols governing the use of the VAR are so chaotically and inconsistently applied, with none of the clear in-game communication to fans that makes video review in other sports like basketball, rugby, and cricket so effective. Match officials have made things even worse for themselves by publicly litigating controversial decisions after the fact in a misguided and haphazard spirit of transparency; in the days and weeks following a refereeing clanger, we all now wait for the inevitable contribution to the discourse from Howard Webb or some suit at the PGMOL, the empty apologies and clarifications only fueling the fire of fan rage.\r\n\r\nClearly a big part of the problem here is about technology and communication, about the systems that have been put in place to deploy the video assistants and strike the right officiating balance between fairness and flow. But some of the blame must also lie with the personnel, with the men who hold the flags, review the tapes, and – most critically – blow the whistles. Speed, decisiveness, courage, an intolerance for continental nonsense and trickery: the qualities essential to English football’s traditional sense of itself are nowhere to be found in the canon of recent Premier League refereeing disasters, which have instead been marked by a strange mixture of pettifogging pedantry and bland, bullocking arrogance.\r\n\r\nCould opening the Premier League to foreign officials make a difference? Is it time for the English top flight to fling open the borders to overseas pea-blowers as it has for the world’s players, managers, and owner-billionaires? This question is now under real consideration at the highest levels: when the Premier League holds its annual general meeting next week, clubs won’t only vote on the proposal to scrap VAR, they’ll also debate whether to open the competition to foreign referees. Widening the labor pool in this way would fit the Premier League’s historical trajectory, completing its journey from insularity to cosmopolitanism, from being an almost totally closed national competition to becoming a global magnet for footballing talent. (There’s the question, naturally, of what this would do to the quality of the leagues in the sending countries, which will presumably be stripped of their best and most experienced match officials, but the numbers migrating will probably be small; there are only 20 full-time professional referees in Select Group 1, the Premier League’s top officiating tier.) The international prestige and status of the English language certainly helps: English is already the default officiating language at the World Cup and in the Champions League for matches involving teams from countries that are linguistic strangers, so most top foreign referees are already fluent enough to be able to control professional football matches in English.\r\n\r\nForeignness is no guarantee, of course, of refereeing competence. The French official Clément Turpin won almost universal acclaim for the style – light-footed, unobtrusive, decisive when needed – in which he managed the first leg of the Champions league semi-final between Bayern Munich and Real Madrid. But in the return leg, the hugely experienced Polish match official Szymon Marciniak – overseer of the 2022 World Cup and 2023 Champions League finals, consistently described as the best referee in the world, a true A-lister – had a rather less impressive showing, blowing (most likely incorrectly, according to the footage) for offside and denying Bayern what would have been a spectacular late equalizer to send the tie into extra time.\r\n\r\nThe perceived quality of refereeing in any given match probably rests more on the overall quality of the spectacle than any particular incident or intervention; people loved Turpin’s performance at the Allianz Arena in part, I suspect, because the match itself was so beltingly entertaining. Every referee is fallible, regardless of nationality; the assistant ref matily blabbering through a botched video review could just as easily come with a Dutch or Italian lilt as an English one. Will ineptitude with a non-British accent make the Premier League more interesting? Will a whole new style of on-field oversight make fans any less angry at the injustices of the whistle than they already are? Could a future Michel Olivier succeed in winning the people’s love where the present Michael Oliver has failed? It seems unlikely.\r\n\r\nOpening the league to the very best foreign officials could make the competition sharper, quicker on its feet, clearer in its decision-making, but it would almost certainly revivify English football’s latent xenophobia at the same time – especially as the first non-British officials make their earliest mistakes. The list of prominent local footballing figures who have lamented, at one time or another, the growing influence of foreigners over the English game is impressively long: it includes some of the usual suspects like Sam Allardyce and Glenn Hoddle, but also more nominally progressive characters like Football Association CEO Mark Bullingham and England manager Gareth Southgate, who last year added his voice to the national chorus of alarm over the influx of foreigners blocking the development of domestic talent. Concerns like these were more common around two decades ago, when the English national team appeared to be in chronic decline, but they’ve become easier to dismiss as the Premier League has continued its march to global supremacy, the clubs have all grown fat off their riches, and England, no longer a big tournament punching bag, has finally begun reap the benefits of having its youth nurtured at club level by the world’s best managers.\r\n\r\nReferees define the basic character of a league much more meaningfully than they’re often given credit for. By definition they are the enforcers of standards; by extension they’re also bulwarks of identity, the people with the power to decide whether a league will be hard tackling or soft in the challenge, lenient on simulation or tough on divers, a competition that plays on or proceeds in stops and starts. The moment a foreign referee gets something wrong, as they inevitably will, it’s not hard to see the criticism they attract shading beyond mere ref-bashing into something much darker. For a league that worked so hard to rid the English game of its most toxic historical influences, these may not be forces that the authorities will want to unleash.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there’s a sunnier scenario possible here, which is that foreign referees may in fact end up doing a better job than their native counterparts. How much worse could things really get? Overseas officials could supply – in very different form, of course – the kind of imaginative fizz and innovation to the task of match control that the first foreign players brought to English football’s on-field action in the dwindling years of last century. To say that there are no foreign referees in the Premier League today is incorrect: there’s one, the Australian Jarred Gillett, a former top A-League referee who began officiating in the UK after moving to Liverpool to undertake post-doctoral research. Gillett was the man at the center of one of the league’s more fascinating (and encouraging) recent experiments with technology: the “RefCam” that he wore throughout the match between Crystal Palace and Manchester United at Selhurst Park on 6 May. Full footage of the match from Gillett’s perspective has yet to be released, but the teaser that has been made public humanizes the referee – an important cultural corrective in an age where match officials are subject to such insane vitriol – and shows the thinking and game awareness needed to control a match at the highest level. RefCam offers some hope that technology, when deployed intelligently, can become an effective part of the Premier League’s future.\r\n\r\nThere’s no knowing whether Gillett himself had any input into its introduction, but the fact he was the man wearing the body camera suggests that foreign referees can play an important role in pushing the sport forward, in embracing fresh thinking and finding new solutions to the problems that keep the internet’s most angry football fans awake at night. Last December Rebecca Welch became the first woman to oversee a Premier League match. Changes in personnel can change the culture of officiating, breaking up some of the smug male laziness behind decisions like the fiasco over the Diaz goal. A new culture, in turn, can make the sport better, fairer, more inclusive, less rabid – without sacrificing the things that make the Premier League such winning entertainment. Referees, wherever they come from, can and should be part of improving the game.\r\n\r\nIn the space of just over thirty years the Premier League has gone from an era in which the players were the sport’s undisputed protagonists to one in which they’ve had to share the stage with managers and, increasingly, owners. But across Europe and especially in England, soccer is moving in a much more technical, legalistic direction. Those who master details and regulations will dominate the sport, both on and off the pitch. Amid the clatter of new technologies, new rules, new ways of visualizing and understanding the game’s possibilities, the age of the referee is upon us. Whether the celebrity officials of the future will be British or foreign is now up to the clubs that run England’s world league to decide.', '30-05-24s01.jpg', '2024-05-30', 'sports'),
(19, 'In the first of a series of special features, we look at how a sport buried by the American civil war is undergoing a revival', '‘Land of opportunity’: USA is cricket’s bold new frontier once again', 'Manhattan’s skyscrapers are built on cricket fields. There was one under Pier 17 at the Seaport on the East River, another beneath the North Meadow of Central Park, and a third right on 1st Avenue and East 32nd St, below the car park of NYU’s Langone Medical Center.\r\n\r\nIn 1844, a crowd of about 5,000 New Yorkers watched the first international match there, between the USA and Canada. “Cricket was the first modern team sport in America,” says Chuck Ramkissoon, in Joseph O’Neill’s great New York novel Netherland, “a bona fide American pastime”. He’s right. It was, once.\r\n\r\nThere were dozens, even hundreds, of clubs in the US in the middle of the 19th century. Historians have never settled on a single reason why cricket died there. The civil war was one factor. “We had a large number of good young men playing the game up to that time, and then the war fever took over them,” one player wrote in the American Cricketer at the beginning of the 20th century.\r\n\r\nBaseball was an easier game for the soldiers to pick up and play because it didn’t need a rolled wicket, specialist coaching or equipment. When they made it professional in 1869, it was packaged and sold as the indigenous American sport. The patriots’ game.\r\n\r\nThere were places where they carried on playing cricket, around Philadelphia in particular, but even that scene sputtered out during the first world war.\r\n\r\nWhich made Netherland a hard novel to sell. “When I was writing it, people would ask: ‘What’s it about?’” says O’Neill. “I’d say: ‘It’s about cricket in New York,’ and people didn’t know what to say back. It really didn’t sound very promising.”\r\n\r\nO’Neill played himself. “When I first arrived in New York in 1998, it was a question of driving around and spotting people playing cricket, stopping and asking them: ‘Can I play?’”\r\n\r\nThere has always been more cricket in the outer boroughs than anyone but the players knew. “It’s a very different cricket culture,” says O’Neill. “The people who love cricket here are often the ones out driving taxis all night.”\r\n\r\nEveryone I talk to in US cricket seems to be chasing a dream of one kind or another, even if it is only a little weekend time playing the game they loved in the home they left behind. “There’s a reason they call it the land of opportunity,” says Ali Khan.\r\n\r\nHe was a teenaged tape-ball player when his family moved from Pakistan in 2010. He assumed he would have to give up cricket because he didn’t think they played it in the US until his uncle took him to their local club in Dayton, Ohio. He played his first proper game that same weekend. Now he is going to be opening the bowling for the national team in the T20 World Cup.\r\n\r\nAmong the dreamers, there have always been some who were thinking even bigger. O’Neill knew one and based the character of Ramkissoon on him. In the novel, Ramkissoon dreams of building a proper stadium outside New York. “An arena for the greatest cricket teams in the world, twelve exhibition matches a summer, watched by eight thousand spectators at fifty dollars a pop.”\r\n\r\nThere are others. I’ve met some myself. I still have a box in the attic filled with promotional leaflets Allen Stanford sent out to the confused locals of Fort Collins, Colorado, which was the test venue for his own effort to break cricket in the US. There was the Pro Cricket League, which began and ended in 2004 after an opening game that was delayed 50 minutes because nobody had any stumps. The Cricket All-Stars series, led by Shane Warne and Sachin Tendulkar, managed three matches. “The USA can be the capital of cricket in the western hemisphere,” Don Lockerbie, the chief executive of the old cricket association, used to say.\r\n\r\nRamkissoon’s stadium is finally there, a temporary build in Eisenhower Park, 30 miles outside the city. “A game between India and Pakistan in New York City?” he says in the book. “In a state of the art arena with Liberty Tower in the background?”\r\n\r\nIt’s finally happening. The match, on 9 June, is one of the hottest tickets in sport in 2024.\r\n\r\nUS cricket isn’t a game for shift workers any more. The men who run it now are leaving long, lucrative careers in Silicon Valley. They launched Minor League Cricket in 2021, Major League Cricket in 2023 and they are still building. MLC’s investors include the managing director of the largest media conglomerate in India, the chief executive of Microsoft, the former chief executive of Adobe and the former director of technology at Amazon. They have credibility, capability, capital, and connections. English cricket now has serious competition in the summer months.\r\n\r\n“It was 10 years ago, when I realized the T20 format is here to stay, that I felt, for the first time, there is an opportunity for this sport in this country,” says Soma Somasegar, who co-owns the MLC’s Seattle Orcas.\r\n\r\nHe grew up in Pondicherry in India and fell in love with cricket from listening to the commentary on his pocket radio. He moved to the US to study, rose to become a senior vice-president at Microsoft and now runs a venture capital firm.\r\n\r\nThe Orcas have set up an academy and are starting work on a new stadium in Seattle. “The next time the World Cup comes to the US,” he says, without stopping to add an if or but, “we will host games in Seattle.”\r\n\r\nSomasegar has a dream, too. “In my mind, the only thing is to see cricket become a mainstream sport here,” he says. “Not just for the diaspora, but to see if we can break through and make cricket a major sport in the coming decades.”\r\n\r\nHe makes the comparison with football, which, he says, nobody took seriously in the US until after the 1994 World Cup. “Now you can’t go to a park without seeing a bunch of kids kicking around a soccer ball, right? Well, ask yourself, why can’t we see something similar with cricket?”', '29-05-24s01.jpg', '2024-05-29', 'sports'),
(24, 'Security services say spate of fires and infrastructure attacks could be part of attempt by Russia to destabilise continent', 'Europe on high alert after suspected Moscow-linked arson and sabotage', 'Security services around Europe are on alert to a potential new weapon of Russia’s war – arson and sabotage – after a spate of mystery fires and attacks on infrastructure in the Baltics, Germany and the UK.\r\n\r\nWhen a fire broke out in Ikea in Vilnius in Lithuania this month, few passed any remarks until the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, suggested it could have been the work of a foreign saboteur.\r\n\r\nInvestigators have already alleged potential Russian involvement in an arson attack in east London, an inferno that destroyed the largest shopping mall in Poland, a sabotage attempt in Bavaria in Germany and antisemitic graffiti in Paris.\r\n\r\nWhile there is no evidence that any of these incidents across the continent are coordinated, security services believe they could be part of an attempt by Moscow to destabilise the west, which has backed Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThey point out that after the cold war, foreign intelligence operations consisted of spies and their handlers, but in the era of social media, vandals can be hired, leaving few connections to other attackers as pay-as-you-go saboteurs paid a few hundred euros or in cryptocurrency.\r\n\r\nSuch is the emerging concern that these hybrid attacks could be the work of Russia that the issue was raised at a summit of foreign and defence ministers in Brussels this week with Dutch, Estonian and Lithuanian security officials all warning of national vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nOne minister, who asked not to be named said, they were deeply worried about “sabotage, physical sabotage, organised, financed and done by Russian proxies”.\r\n\r\nLast week, Tusk revealed Polish authorities had arrested nine people in connection with acts of sabotage allegedly committed on the orders of Russian services.\r\n\r\nHe said the crimes allegedly included “beatings, arson and attempted arson” with investigators looking into whether Russia was involved in the fire in a shopping centre in Warsaw, a claim the Russian embassy described as a conspiracy theory.\r\n\r\nA spokesperson for Ikea said investigations were continuing into the source of the fire in Lithuania but it was among the examples, along with an attempted arson attack on a paint factory in Poland, that Tusk cited in his warning of potential foreign interference.\r\n\r\nIn April, a British man was accused of orchestrating an arson attack on two units linked to a Ukrainian businessman in an industrial estate in Leyton, east London, after allegedly being recruited by Russian intelligence. The Crown Prosecution Service claimed he was “engaged in conduct targeting businesses which were linked to Ukraine in order to benefit the Russian state”.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the Estonian defence minister, Hanno Pevkur, in Brussels for an EU defence summit, said the country had already been the victim of Russian sabotage.\r\n\r\n“They have conducted similar operations in Estonia. They hired 10 people to attack the car of the interior minister and a journalist’s car. This is normal behaviour of Russia. We are sorry to say but we need to understand that Russia is more and more aggressive towards European countries and also Nato countries,” he said.\r\n\r\nHe was referring to incidents in February when the windows of cars belonging to the interior minister, Lauri Läänemets, and a journalist were smashed.\r\n\r\nSix people were arrested shortly afterwards, including Russian nationals and dual Russian-Estonian citizens, the prosecutor said.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, there are also suspicions of foreign intelligence-driven attacks in addition to a wave of cyber-attacks in 2023 by a hacker group linked to Russian intelligence.\r\n\r\nLast month, two German-Russian nationals were arrested on suspicion of plotting sabotage attacks including on a military base in Bavaria. The main suspect has been accused of plotting an explosion, arson and maintaining contact with Russian intelligence.\r\n\r\nInvestigators in France are considering whether graffiti painted on Paris’s Holocaust memorial last week was ordered by Russian security services.\r\n\r\nIt has echoes of an attack last year when the Star of David was spray-painted on buildings in and around Paris, prompting fears of a recurrence of Nazi-era attempts to identify the homes of Jewish people. Authorities later said they believed the attack may have been a “demand” of an individual living abroad.\r\n\r\nThe attacks, European officials fear, add to an already proliferating disinformation campaign. On Wednesday, several schools around Athens were evacuated after a bomb hoax. Police traced to a Russian server and said the stunt was aimed at “disrupting public order”.\r\n\r\nEU countries are tracking these events. Lithuania’s national crisis management centre (NKVC) has warned businesses including shopping centres and organisations supporting Ukraine to heighten their vigilance.\r\n\r\nVilmantas Vitkauskas, the head of the NKVC, told reporters two weeks ago: “The threat level is quite high. We urge the public to remain vigilant.”\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the Dutch national coordinator for security and counter-terrorism warned of the risk of subversive operations in the Netherlands including “espionage and pre-positioning for sabotage of vital infrastructure”.\r\n\r\nIn Brussels on Tuesday, the Dutch defence minister, Kajsa Ollongren, said Russia was “trying to intimidate” Nato countries, making EU member states vulnerable.\r\n\r\n“Yes, we are vulnerable. I think all of us are. We have vital infrastructure. We have seabed infrastructure, we have electricity supplies, water supplies, we’re vulnerable to cyber-attacks.We are seeing now in several European countries that Russia is trying to destabilise us and also to intimidate us.\r\n\r\n“I think this has been a way that Russia and also the Soviet Union has worked throughout recent history, really; in the 75 years of Nato I think we’ve seen it often,” she said.\r\n\r\nNato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has also pointed the finger at Moscow. “We have seen several arrests across the alliance and different Nato allied countries of people who are accused of arson or sabotage. These are of course ongoing legal processes,” he said. “But what I can say is that we have seen increased Russian intelligence activity across the alliance. Therefore we have increased our vigilance.”', '30-05-24n02.jpg', '2024-05-30', 'news'),
(31, 'Elections pit mainstream parties against far-right newcomers amid hardening public mood on asylum policy', '‘Feeling of fear and hatred’: immigration dominates agenda as Ireland votes in local and EU polls', 'The Shannon Key West hotel sits silent and derelict in the village of Roosky, its windows boarded up, the grounds colonised by weeds. Birds nest in the roof and occasionally swoop out, breaking the stillness.\r\n\r\nThe hotel closed in 2011 and was to reopen in 2019 as a home for 80 refugees – but it was damaged in an arson attack in January of that year. In case the message wasn’t clear enough, weeks later came a second arson attack.\r\n\r\nThe government abandoned the refugee plan and five years later the hotel in Roosky, which straddles the counties of Leitrim and Roscommon, remains empty, a symbol of a backlash that has transformed Ireland’s politics and framed Friday’s local and European elections.\r\n\r\nThe blazes augured a dramatic shift in a country that once prided itself on welcoming refugees – a shift that has unfolded through copycat arson attacks, street protests, social media trolling, far-right candidacies and government sweeps of refugee encampments.\r\n\r\nThe contest for votes on 7 June has pitted mainstream parties against far-right newcomers with slogans such as “Ireland is full” and “Ireland for the Irish” that link a housing shortage with migrants and asylum seekers. “House the Irish, not the world!” say leaflets for the National party, one of several tiny, far-right parties that are vying to win their first seats. Agitators seek to link foreign men with sexual assaults, and protests against proposed refugee accommodation sites occur almost weekly.\r\n\r\nThe dynamic has damaged Sinn Féin, the leftwing opposition party which has a working-class base and a progressive record on asylum seekers. From 37% voter support in October 2022 it now has about 22%, according to recent polls. Anti-immigrant rallies sport posters of Sinn Féin’s leader, Mary Lou McDonald, with the word “traitor”.\r\n\r\nSupport for the centrist ruling coalition of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Greens has nudged upwards to 43% while support for small opposition parties and independents has surged to 23%.\r\n\r\nThe hardening public mood on immigration and asylum policy – almost two-thirds want tougher controls – is most pronounced among young, urban, low-income voters. It rivals housing as voters’ priority, with healthcare, climate change and the cost of living lagging far behind.\r\n\r\nAgitators have stirred hostility to foreigners, said Martin Kenny, a Sinn Féin Dáil deputy who represents Sligo and Leitrim. “They have generated this feeling of fear and hatred towards migrants and anyone who supports migrants. This is a tiny minority of people that fire up another minority. It has become a trend.”\r\n\r\nIn October 2019, months after the Roosky fires, Kenny supported a fresh effort to settle refugees in a nearby town. He awoke at home up one night to find his car in the driveway turned into a fireball, the heat so intense it cracked the house’s windows.\r\n\r\nIntimidation of elected representatives has spread, creating a perilous environment for candidates and canvassers. Two men in the street quizzed Tania Doyle, a Dublin councillor, about her views on migration before launching a violent assault. A man shouting far-right sentiments lunged at Janet Horner, a Green party councillor, as she erected posters in the capital.\r\n\r\nA video shared on social media showed men ordering Linkwinstar Mattathil Mathew, a Fine Gael local election candidate originally from India, to take down his posters. “Fuck off back from where you came from, this is our country,” said one of them. Last weekend hecklers followed and filmed the taoiseach, Simon Harris, on a walkabout in County Mayo.\r\n\r\nSuch incidents are sporadic and widely condemned. Contests for 949 council seats in 31 local government authorities, 14 seats in the European parliament and a directly elected mayor of Limerick have been overwhelmingly peaceful, even low key.\r\n\r\nFor decades, seismic societal change – a monocultural, white population became one where a fifth of the population was born abroad – caused barely a political ripple. That changed after a rise in arrivals of refugees from Ukraine and other countries was perceived by some to have overwhelmed a rickety asylum system, which ran out of accommodation.\r\n\r\nIntermittent protests spread and gained traction by linking refugee shelters and encampments to the housing shortage. Agitators also sought to link arrivals to crime, leading to a riot in Dublin last November.\r\n\r\nFar-right candidates may struggle to get elected – there are so many they could split the vote, and they lack the vote-mobilising machinery of established parties.\r\n\r\nBut they have set the agenda. The government has tightened rules, reduced welfare supports and expanded enforcement to deter fresh asylum seekers. The taoiseach has insisted Ireland will apply “common sense” while retaining compassion: “The reason we apply the rules is not because we wish to be nasty, is not because we wish to learn from other countries whom I wouldn’t frankly wish to learn from.”\r\n\r\nIreland’s edging towards policies common across Europe is traceable to the arson in Roosky and an earlier attack on a hotel earmarked for asylum seekers in Moville, County Donegal, in November 2018.\r\n\r\nThose incidents set a template for about 25 subsequent arson attacks, said Paul Healy, editor of the Roscommon People newspaper. “Donegal and Roosky were the beginning but it could have been anywhere. There was a sense of the issue being hijacked. It’s a campaign orchestrated by small groups of people that seem to move around the country.”\r\n\r\nIt is now a familiar pattern: locals complain about lack of consultation and amenities, outside agitators arrive, protests escalate, then arson is committed. Leftwing activists say far-right elements surfaced a decade ago in a campaign against water charges and moved to migration, mimicking rhetoric and methods from the US. They infiltrate neighbourhood Facebook groups, radicalise discourse and seek a domino effect, said one activist.\r\n\r\nJosephine Stroker, a manager at the Leitrim Volunteer Centre, said refugees contributed to the community, for instance by bolstering Tidy Town clean-up teams, but that public sentiment was cooling towards non-Ukrainians. “The welcome is not as warm for those from Africa and the Middle East. Sadly the colour of skin makes a difference.”\r\n\r\nKenny, the Sinn Féin legislator, said the election was an opportunity to debunk the link between refugees and the housing crisis and to remind voters that migrant workers sustained the health service and construction and hospitality industries. “We have to be patient and to explain that problems are caused by bad government. Ireland has an obligation to receive people and make them feel welcome.”\r\n\r\nRoosky, meanwhile, has welcomed at least one immigrant: its new parish priest, Father Willie Sakwe, from Cameroon. “The people here have been very good,” he said. “I have had no problems. Maybe because I’m a priest.”', '05-06-24n01.jpg', '2024-06-05', 'news');
